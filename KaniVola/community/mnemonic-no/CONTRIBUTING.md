#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/pdblist/issues)

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** and/or an **--verbose output** demonstrating the bug.

* If you really want to make us happy; include a way to get hold of a memory image where it is failing and as much information as possible about the system it is dumped from and how it was aquired.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability or functionality will generally not be accepted.

* Start writing code. When you are done, open a pull request.
